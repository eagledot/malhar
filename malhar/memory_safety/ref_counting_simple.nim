# Enough reference counting for production use.
# Main use is to `free` resources automatically(correctly).
# Alternative would be to inject `free` or `deallocRecord` manually, but with non-trivial codebases it would not play well, but users would be allowed to bypass this (with the risk of memory being freed at wrong time! or leakage)
